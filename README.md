# Data Cleaning with Python Project
My client, a call center, was struggling with employees wasting time due to incorrect or incomplete data, particularly when trying to find the correct phone numbers. I solved this problem using Python with Pandas in Jupyter, ensuring that the call center's customer contact list was accurate and ready for use.

**Work Done**
- Removed duplicate records to eliminate redundancies.
- Corrected formatting issues in names and phone numbers, stripping unwanted characters.
- Split full addresses into structured components such as street address, state, and zip code.
- Filtered out rows based on specific criteria, including consent flags ('Do_Not_Contact') and missing phone numbers.
- Standardized entries for consistency, such as converting 'Yes'/'No' to 'Y'/'N'.
