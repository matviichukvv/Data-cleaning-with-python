Split full addresses into structured components like street address, state, and zip code.
Remove rows based on specific criteria such as consent flags ('Do_Not_Contact') and missing phone numbers.
Standardize entries for ease of analysis (e.g., converting 'Yes'/'No' to 'Y'/'N').
Data Export: Prepared data is showcased in the notebook, ready for further analysis or direct use in marketing and customer service operations.

### Skills Used:

Python
Pandas for data manipulation
Jupyter Notebook for project documentation and code execution
